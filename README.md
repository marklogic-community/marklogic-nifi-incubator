# MarkLogic NiFi Incubator

* This incubator has new processors, community recipes, and some fixes or extensions to core MarkLogic processors.

* This incubator is "ahead" of the supported MarkLogic NiFi product

* The incubator includes new processors, bug fixes, and extensions to the processors from the MarkLogic NiFi project. It is not supported by MarkLogic Support. For issues with the incubator project, create an issue in the GitHub project.

* This is the MarkLogic NiFi Incubator, supported by the MarkLogic community. It is forked from the MarkLogic NiFi and is intended for developers to be able to contribute to and extend the project for their needs. 

* This incubator is not supported by MarkLogic Support, so issues should be resolved here if they are with the incubator, vs issues with core supported processors which should be reported to MarkLogic Support

* The official MarkLogic fork of the Apache NiFi project (https://github.com/marklogic/nifi) is available and supported by MarkLogic. More information can be found at https://developer.marklogic.com/features/apache-nifi/.

* Please use the official [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/) release when deploying NiFi.
